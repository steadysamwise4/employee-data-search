## Description <a name="description"></a>
<sub>_***Built With:***_</sub> <sub>JavaScript,ES6,Node.JS, mySQL</sub> </br>
This application tracks employee data at a fictional company using a mysql database. By running it in the command line, a user can view Departments, view Job titles, view employees, add a Department, add a Job title, add an employee, Update an employee's Job title or Manager, view employees by Department or by Manager, delete a Department, Job title, or an Employee, or view the total utilized budget of each department. This project was created from scratch. It was very difficult, but also very rewarding to have completed. I feel as though I have definitely leveled up in my ability to work with mysql and javaScript after this trial by fire of a bootcamp challenge. I spent lots of time here, but it was time that I enjoyed. I have to credit Joelle DesChatelets again. I used her project as a template early on for how I wanted to set things up. I wanted to modularize the code, but struggled and decided to just keep it all on the server.js file. In the future, I would like to refactor and place those functions into separate files for better organization and readability. I'm sure that I could make it much more DRY as well and that may be something I use to improve my knowledge in the future as well. I do feel good about this one at this point, though. I solved many of my own problems and issues, many of which were silly mistakes. It has absolutely been a great experience working on this challenge. I am looking forward to the next.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Clone the Repo to your local files. Run npm init -y in the command line. Run npm install inquirer console.table mysql2. In the mysql shell, run source db/db.sql, source db/schema.sql, source db/seeds.sql. You may wish to place your own data into the seeds.sql file. Once this is done quit the mysql shell and run npm start in the command line. Follow the prompts.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Follow the prompts to view, add, update, and delete data from the database according to your wishes.
